# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Adil Abubacker

🚀 Full Stack Developer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🔧 Systems Thinker

I'm a results driven Full Stack Developer with a passion for building high-performance distributed systems. I write code that makes both users and developers smile. With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, and hands-on experience leading full-scale projects, I thrive at the intersection of backend robustness and frontend finesse.

class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

        self.languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
        self.backend = ["Django", "DRF", "Celery", "Django Channels", "WebSockets"]
        self.frontend = ["React", "Redux", "Tailwind CSS"]
        self.infrastructure = ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "AWS EKS", "EC2", "Kafka"]
        self.databases = ["PostgreSQL", "Elasticsearch", "Redis", "MySQL"]

## 💡 Fun Fact

When I'm not orchestrating microservices, you might find me tackling complex algorithms on LeetCode (555+ problems and counting!) or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (spaces, obviously 😉).


## 🧠 Current Focus

Currently diving deeper into distributed systems design and exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. Always looking for the next technical challenge that makes me think, "This is going to be fun!"
