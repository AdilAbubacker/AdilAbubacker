# 👋 Hey there, I'm Adil Abubacker!

🚀 Full Stack Developer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🔧 Systems Thinker

I'm a results-driven Full Stack Developer with a passion for building scalable, high-performance systems. I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions. With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, and hands-on experience leading full-scale projects, I thrive at the intersection of backend robustness and frontend finesse.
