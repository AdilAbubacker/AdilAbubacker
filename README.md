# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Adil Abubacker

🚀 Full Stack Engineer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🔧 Systems Thinker

Welcome to my corner of the internet where scalable architecture meets clean code! I'm a Full-Stack Engineer who gets genuinely excited about microservices, distributed systems, and making computers do impossible things at scale. With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, and hands-on experience leading full-scale projects, I work at the intersection of scale, performance, and clean architecture.

## 🛠️ What I Build With

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.role = "Full Stack Developer"
        self.languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
        self.backend = ["Django", "DRF", "Celery", "Django Channels", "WebSockets"]
        self.frontend = ["React", "Redux", "Tailwind CSS"]
        self.infrastructure = ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "AWS EKS", "EC2", "Kafka"]
        self.databases = ["PostgreSQL", "Elasticsearch", "Redis", "MySQL"]
        
    def greet(self):
        return f"Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together."

adil = Developer("Adil Abubacker")
print(adil.greet())
```

## 🏆 Highlights

- 🎭 Built **RentEzy** - a property management platform with 10+ microservices that actually talk to each other nicely
- 🎖️ **LeetCode Knight** with 1900 rating (Top 4% globally) - because algorithms are my playground
- 🔥 Led full-stack development - reduced API load by **80%** and mentored team of 3 developers

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### [RentEzy](https://github.com/AdilAbubacker/rentezy_backend)
A  proptech masterpiece with 10+ independently horizontally scalable microservices featuring automated recurring rent payment system, real-time chat, visit-scheduling, event-driven notifications, concurrency-safe booking and more. Built with Django, React, Kafka, Celery, Elasticsearch and deployed on AWS EKS. Because why make it simple when you can make it scalable?

### [LitHub](https://github.com/AdilAbubacker/LitHub)
Full-stack book marketplace with advanced filtering, secure payments, and a wallet system. Sometimes the best solutions are the elegant ones.

## 💡 Fun Fact

When I'm not orchestrating microservices, you might find me tackling complex algorithms on LeetCode (777+ problems and counting!) or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (spaces, obviously 😉).


## 🧠 Current Focus

Currently diving deeper into distributed systems design and exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. Always looking for the next technical challenge that makes me think, "This is going to be fun!"
