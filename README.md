# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Adil Abubacker

🚀 Full Stack Developer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🔧 Systems Thinker

Welcome to my corner of the internet where scalable architecture meets clean code! I'm a Full-Stack Developer who gets genuinely excited about microservices, real-time systems, and making computers do impossible things at scale. With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, and hands-on experience leading full-scale projects, I write code that makes both users and developers smile.

## 🛠️ What I Build With

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.role = "Full Stack Developer"
        self.languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
        self.backend = ["Django", "DRF", "Celery", "Django Channels", "WebSockets"]
        self.frontend = ["React", "Redux", "Tailwind CSS"]
        self.infrastructure = ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "AWS EKS", "EC2", "Kafka"]
        self.databases = ["PostgreSQL", "Elasticsearch", "Redis", "MySQL"]
        
    def greet(self):
        return f"Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together."

adil = Developer("Adil Abubacker")
print(adil.greet())
```

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### [RentEzy](https://github.com/AdilAbubacker/rentezy_backend)
A microservices masterpiece with automated payment system, real-time chat, visit-scheduling and concurrency-safe booking. Built with Django, React, Kafka, Celery, Elasticsearch and deployed on AWS EKS because why make it simple when you can make it scalable?

### [LitHub](https://github.com/your-username/LitHub)
Full-stack book marketplace with advanced filtering, secure payments, and a wallet system. Sometimes the best solutions are the elegant ones.

## 💡 Fun Fact

When I'm not orchestrating microservices, you might find me tackling complex algorithms on LeetCode (555+ problems and counting!) or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (spaces, obviously 😉).


## 🧠 Current Focus

Currently diving deeper into distributed systems design and exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. Always looking for the next technical challenge that makes me think, "This is going to be fun!"
