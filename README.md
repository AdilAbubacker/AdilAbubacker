# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Adil Abubacker

🚀 Full Stack Developer | 🧠 Problem Solver | 🔧 Systems Thinker

I'm a results-driven Full Stack Developer with a passion for building high-performance distributed systems. I write code that makes both users and developers smile. With a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, and hands-on experience leading full-scale projects, I thrive at the intersection of backend robustness and frontend finesse.

## 🛠️ What I Build With

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.role = "Full Stack Developer"
        self.languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
        self.backend = ["Django", "DRF", "Celery", "Django Channels", "WebSockets"]
        self.frontend = ["React", "Redux", "Tailwind CSS"]
        self.infrastructure = ["Docker", "Kubernetes", "AWS EKS", "EC2", "Kafka"]
        self.databases = ["PostgreSQL", "Elasticsearch", "Redis", "MySQL"]
        self.currently_learning = "Advanced System Design Patterns"
        
    def greet(self):
        return f"Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together."

adil = Developer("Adil Abubacker")
print(adil.greet())
```

## 💡 Fun Fact

When I'm not architecting microservices, you might find me tackling complex algorithms on LeetCode (550+ problems and counting!) or debating whether tabs or spaces are superior (spaces, obviously 😉).


## 🧠 Current Focus

Currently diving deeper into distributed systems design and exploring the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence. Always looking for the next technical challenge that makes me think, "This is going to be fun!"

## 🚀 About Me

Full Stack Developer by day, problem-solving addict by night. I architect scalable systems that make both users and developers smile. With a foundation built on 550+ LeetCode problems and a passion for clean, efficient code, I transform complex challenges into elegant solutions.

When I'm not refactoring 10,000-line codebases into neat 200-line components, you might find me orchestrating microservices like a tech conductor or optimizing database queries for that extra millisecond of performance.

## 💻 Tech Arsenal

```
⚡ Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
🛠️ Backend: Django, DRF, Celery, Django Channels, WebSockets, REST API, JWT
🏗️ Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EKS, EC2, EFS, S3)
📊 Data: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis
🔄 Microservices: Apache Kafka
🔤 Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
```

## 🏆 Highlights

- Led development of a financial analysis platform, slashing API load by 85%
- Engineered a microservices architecture with 10+ independently scalable services
- Built concurrency-safe booking systems with transactional locking
- Implemented real-time notification systems with WebSockets
- Containerized applications with Docker & deployed on Kubernetes
